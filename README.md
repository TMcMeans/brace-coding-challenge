# Pokedex

![](/src/assets/banner.png)

Pokedex is a basic React app that mimics the behavior of a [Pokedex](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/), a mini encyclopedia of Pokemon species, types, evolutions and moves. Pokemon data is consumed and rendered on the UI via the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), a free public RESTful API.

NOTE: This app is not responsive. It is built to be viewed at max screen width, please maximize your screen window before starting this app on your local machine.
